        PYIGroup provides its website and related services to you
        (&ldquo;Seller&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) subject to this User
        Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;), the Intellectual Property
        Complaint Policy (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;), the Counter-Notice Policy, the
        Repeat Intellectual Property Complaint Policy, the Refund Policy, and
        the Privacy Policy (this Agreement and the foregoing policies
        collectively referred to as &ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;). All of the
        terms and obligations set forth in the foregoing policies are
        incorporated by reference.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Delivery Procedure</strong></p>
      <p>
        Any time quoted for delivery is an estimate only; provided, however,
        that PYIGroup shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all
        merchandise on or before the stated delivery date. No delay in shipment
        or delivery of any merchandise relieves Seller of their obligations
        under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Print Variance</strong></p>
      <p>
        Product production is generated from the artwork uploaded by the seller.
        The estimated positioning of the art work is provided by the seller.
        Print size and exact location may vary based on the product size. Colors
        are best matched to the artwork provided. PYIGroup may substitute
        comparable products if stock becomes an issue. Exact print size,
        location, and colors are not guaranteed; and are completely dependent on
        the artwork uploaded by the seller.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Price and Payment</strong></p>
      <p>
        Seller shall determine the price of the merchandise sold for each
        campaign, PYIGroup shall retain from the customer payments, PYIGroup
        will determine the base price as the cost of goods sold (including any
        additional expenses and fees PYIGroup determines necessary to comply
        with the terms of this Agreement), and remit to Seller any amount in
        excess of such base price (&ldquo;Seller Profits&rdquo;).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that PYIGroup reserves the right to remove any

        Policy below, unauthorized use of its intellectual property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon receipt by PYIGroup of an allegation of infringement that comports
        with PYIGroup&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Complaint Policy, in
        PYIGroup&rsquo;s sole discretion, your campaign may be subject to

      </p>

        use of PYIGroup&rsquo;s site and services, your violation of this
        Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another.

      <h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINT POLICY</h4>
      <p>
        PYIGroup keeps the rights to sweep any infringement contents related to
        (but not limit) trade mark, copyrights and other content violations. All
        the content uploaded by user should go through our review process with 2
        steps as below:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the first round, our platform will do a check by our bot. Our bot
          will automatically crawl all the user generated contents and match it
          with Google Vision library. If it found any content violation, the
          platform will flag the campaign immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some tricky designs should be able to pass the bot. We have our second
          round of reviewing by humans to make sure we can catch those content.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        PYIGroup provides users with a platform to sell their own merchandise.
        Users contractually agree to all terms prior to use of PYIGroup
        services. PYIGroup contractually prohibits users from using its services
        to sell merchandise that infringes upon third party intellectual
        property rights (such as copyright, trademark, trade dress, and right of
        publicity).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is PYIGroup policy to block and remove any content that it believes
        in good faith to infringe the intellectual property rights of third
        parties following receipt of a compliant notice; and to terminate
        service for repeated infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been
        infringed upon by a PYIGroup user, please notify PYIGroup
        at&nbsp;legal@pyiexpress.net. You must include within your notification
        the following information:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
          behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that you allege is
          being infringed
        </li>
        <li>

          of the allegedly infringing merchandise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the copyright, trademark, or other rights that
          allegedly have been infringed, including proof of ownership (such as

        </li>
        <li>
          Your full name, address, telephone number(s), and email address(es).
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material
          in the URL submitted is unauthorized by the rights owner, or its
          licensee, and such use amounts to infringement under federal or state
          law.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the
          notification is complete and accurate and that you are authorized to
          act on behalf of the owner of the intellectual property or other right
          that is allegedly infringed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>COUNTER-NOTICE POLICY</h4>
      <p>
        If you believe that a claim of intellectual property infringement was
        filed by mistake or misidentification you may file a counter-notice. If
        you materially misrepresent in your counter-notice that your design is
        not infringing upon the intellectual property, you may be liable for
        damages to the intellectual property owner (including costs and
        attorney&rsquo;s fees). Therefore, if you are unsure whether or not the
        material infringes on the intellectual property, please contact an
        attorney before filing the counter-notice. The counter-notice should be
        submitted to&nbsp;legal@pyiexpress.net&nbsp;and must include the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>
          Your full name, address, telephone number(s), and email address(es);
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material and its location before it was removed,
          either by URL to the PYIGroup campaign(s) used in connection with the
          sale of the allegedly infringing merchandise or PYIGroup campaign
          number;
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement under penalty of perjury that the claim of intellectual
          property infringement that led to the removal or blockage of access to
          material was filed by mistake or misidentification;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district
          where you live (if you are in the U.S.), or your consent to the
          jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where your service
          provider is located (if you are not in the U.S.);
        </li>
        <li>
          Your consent to accept service of process from the party who submitted
          the takedown notice or an agent of that party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you submit a counter-notice, a copy of the counter-notice may be sent
        to the complaining party informing the complaining party that PYIGroup
        may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business
        days. Unless the intellectual property owner files an action seeking a
        court order against you, the removed material may be replaced or access
        to it restored in 10 to 14 business days after receipt of the
        counter-notice.
      </p>
      <h4>REPEAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINT POLICY</h4>
      <p>
        If PYIGroup receives repeated notices that you have posted others&rsquo;
        intellectual property without permission, PYIGroup may terminate your
        account. PYIGroup has a system for keeping track of repeat violators of
        intellectual property rights of others, and determining when to suspend
        or terminate your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        PYIGroup reserves the right to terminate accounts that act against the
        spirit of the Terms of Use, regardless of how many strikes are involved.
      </p>
      <h4>WITHHOLDING AND TAX MATTERS</h4>
      <p>
        It is contemplated that the services and transactions described in this
        Agreement will not impose a withholding obligation upon PYIGroup under
        Section 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the
        &ldquo;Code&rdquo;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
        PYIGroup concludes that it has an obligation to withhold under Section
        1442 of the Code (or other applicable law) with respect to Seller
        Profits, PYIGroup will withhold all applicable income tax from any
        payments or Seller Profits otherwise due to Seller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seller shall be solely responsible for payment of its own tax
        liabilities which may arise under the Agreement, and shall indemnify
        PYIGroup for any tax obligations, including for federal income tax
        withholding, which may arise as a result of this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h4>INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
      <p>
        Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PYIGroup and
        PYIGroup&rsquo;s affiliates, employees, officers, directors, and agents
        from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, damages,
        liabilities, losses, settlements, costs and expenses (including
        attorneys&rsquo; fees) which arise out of or relate to (i) any content
        submitted or posted by Seller, (ii) Seller&rsquo;s use of, or connection
        with, PYIGroup&rsquo;s website, (iii) Seller&rsquo;s violation of any of
        the terms of this Agreement or the Terms of Use, or (iv) Seller&rsquo;s
        violation of any rights of a third party. To secure Seller&rsquo;s
        prompt and complete payment and performance of any and all present and
        future indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of Seller to PYIGroup
        including with respect to any indemnification arising out of the
        Agreement or the Terms of Use, Seller hereby grants PYIGroup a security
        interest in all proceeds of the merchandise (including Seller Profits
        and insurance proceeds). PYIGroup shall be entitled to all applicable
        rights and remedies of a secured party under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        IN NO EVENT SHALL PYIGROUP&rsquo;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR
        RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE Terms of Use, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR
        RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE,
        EXCEED THE AMOUNT OTHERWISE OWED TO SELLER AS SELLER PROFIT.

        CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS
        INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR
        OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF PYIGROUP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
        NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE
        OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
        SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY MERCHANDISE, DATA,

        TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION
        EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID PYIGROUP OR PYIGROUP HAS PAID YOU IN THE
        LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, FIFTY DOLLARS ($50). THE FOREGOING
        LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
        LAW.

        PYIGroup preserves the right to deal with individuals and organizations
        that intentionally exploit system vulnerabilities in order to usurp

        For all Products except apparel, we will print your Product shortly
        after the completion of your order and ship the Product in due course.
        For Products that are apparel (e.g., t-shirts), all Products of the same
        type will be printed and shipped. Customer(s) can expect to receive
        their products 14-21 business days after their payment has been received
        and their order processed. Customer(s) acknowledges and agrees that the
        stated delivery time frame of 14-21 business days is an estimate, and
        under certain instances (such as delays caused by the postal service,
        delays due to weather events or natural disasters) deliveries may exceed
        the stated time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>International:</strong>&nbsp;Certain countries do not provide
        international tracking once the shipment has left the country that our
        store located. If Seller experiences a lost or delayed shipment, Seller
        should ask the 3rd Party Customer to reach out to their local post
        office to inquire about which carrier UPS connects to in their country.
        PYIGroup is not responsible for providing a list of the aforementioned
        countries nor contacting the third-party carrier on the Seller&rsquo;s
        or 3rd Party Customer's behalf.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lost or Stolen Shipments</strong></p>
      <p>
        PYIGroup does not guarantee domestic and/or international shipments nor
        handle returns or exchanges. Certain countries are considered "high
        risk" for issues such as lost or stolen and/or lost-in-transit
        shipments. Shipping PYIGroup products domestically &amp; internationally
        are at the sole risk of the Seller. PYIGroup is not liable for shipments
        that do not deliver successfully.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cancellations, Refunds, &amp; Exchanges</strong></p>
      <p>
        Due to the customized characteristics of Products, we do not allow
        cancellations, exchanges, or refunds. If upon delivery of the product
        you feel that your order was incorrect due to error on our part, such as
        the wrong color, item size, or design, please email us within fourteen
        days of your delivery. Claims will be handled on a case basis. You
        acknowledge and agree that goods produced by us for you are bespoke,
        custom-made goods. Other than where goods are faulty, you have no right
        to cancel any order or return any goods and all orders are final.

      <h5>PRINTING &amp; PRODUCTION</h5>
      <p>
        PYIGroup prohibits Sellers from using the service to sell merchandise
        that infringes upon third party intellectual property rights (such as
        copyright, trademark, trade dress, and right of publicity). Merchandise
        production is generated from the artwork and mock-up provided by the
        Seller (3rd Party Platform seller). Print size may vary based on the
        individual product size. Colors are best matched to the artwork, and
        PYIGroup may substitute comparable products if stock becomes an issue.
        Exact print size, location, and colors are not guaranteed. Seller is
        responsible for checking his/her "Action Required&rdquo; tab within 3rd
        Party Platform and it is Seller&rsquo;s responsibility to take manual
        action if there is an address or payment issue. It is the sole
        responsibility of the Seller to rectify the issue manually before
        PYIGroup can continue with production. PYIGroup is not responsible for
        orders that are not processed due to these aforementioned issues.
      </p>
