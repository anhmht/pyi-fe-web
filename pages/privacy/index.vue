      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        We take seriously the privacy of our website Members and Visitors.
        Please read this privacy policy to learn more about how we treat
        information, including personally identifiable information, in
        connection with your use of the pyiexpress.net website and online
        service (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). We provide this privacy policy
        because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is
        used and protected, and the circumstances under which it may be shared
        or disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns
        regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at
        privacy@pyiexpress.net.
      </p>
      <h3>What This Policy Covers</h3>
      <p>
        This policy covers the ways we treat information, including personally
        identifiable information, that we obtain from you when you visit our
        website, order Products through the Service, register to become a Member
        of the Service, or join our VIP Seller Program. We regard
        &ldquo;personally identifiable information&rdquo; as information we
        obtain from you that someone can use to identify or contact you in
        person, such as your real name, telephone number, email address, or
        physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify
        you as a Member or a Visitor in our system (e.g., your User ID) is not
        considered personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <h3>What This Policy Does Not Cover</h3>
      <p>
        This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties, such
        as the practices of third-party payment processing or delivery services,
        or our Sellers, partners, and/or advertisers. In addition, we may
        provide links to other services and on occasion to other websites that
        may interest you. All of these websites operate independently of the
        Service and each has its own privacy and security practices. We
        encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal
        information to them.
      </p>
      <h3>

      <h3>Other Information We Collect</h3>
      <h4>Log Files &amp; Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to many websites and internet services, we gather certain

        information includes your web request, Internet Protocol
        (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address information, unique device identifier (e.g.,
        UDID, MAC Address, etc.), browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,
        number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other
        such information. We may analyze such data using our own analytics,
        Google Analytics, or other similar third-party services. To learn more
        about how Google Analytics collects and uses your data when you use this
        site, and how you can control the information sent to Google Analytics,

        >. We use these log files and analytics to improve and administer our
        site, to analyze trends, and to gather information about our user base.
      </p>
      <h4>Pixels, aka Web Beacons</h4>
      <p>
        We may employ pixels, aka web beacons, which are small blocks of code
        that do things like allow us or another server to measure viewing of a

        Visitors. In addition, we may also use pixels or web beacons in
        HTML-based emails we send, to help us track which emails are opened by
        recipients. This information is used to enable more accurate reporting,
        improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make the Service better
        for our Members and Visitors. We may ask advertisers or other partners
        to serve ads or services to computers, mobile phones, or other devices,
        which may use a cookie, pixel, or other similar technology placed by us
        or the third party.
      </p>

        We may use the information we collect to calculate and publish
        anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our

      <h2>How We Share and Disclose Information</h2>
      <h3>With Third Parties</h3>
      <h4>To Provide You With The Service</h4>
      <p>
        We share your information, including your personally identifiable
        information, for the purpose of providing you with the Service and with
        any Product you may order through the Service. For example, if you order
        a physical Product though the Service, we will provide our shipping
        partners with your name and physical address.
      </p>
      <h4>To Help Connect Buyers and Sellers</h4>
      <p>
        If you place an order from a Seller who is or becomes a member of our
        VIP Seller Program, we will share your email address with the Seller.
        This allows Buyers and Sellers to directly connect, and helps Sellers
        gain valuable feedback from our community and promote their upcoming
        projects and Campaigns.
      </p>
      <h4>Sharing, Renting, &amp; Selling Information We Collect</h4>
      <p>
        Except as provided herein, we will neither rent nor sell your personally
        identifiable information to any other third party not under our common
        ownership or common corporate control. For example, if you purchase a
        Product from Seller who is or becomes a member of our Seller Program, we
        will share your email address with the seller from whom your purchase
        was made. Occasionally we share aggregate information about our Members
        and Visitors with partners or advertisers, and we may publish these
        aggregate usage statistics on our website for the interest of our users.
      </p>
      <h4>Linked Services</h4>
      <p>
        In some cases, we allow you to access or link to other web services
        through our Service. For example, we may allow you to share Campaigns
        using Facebook and Twitter, among other services, which requires that
        you open accounts on those services themselves. We also allow you to pay
        for Products purchased through the Service using our selected third
        party payment-processing provider. In such cases, those services may
        choose to collect your personal information as they deem appropriate. As
        noted above, we are neither responsible for nor in control of how third
        parties collect, use, or disclose information obtained through these
        linked services. We encourage you to be aware when using these
        third-party services and to review their policies before submitting any
        personal information to them.
      </p>
      <h4>Third-Party Service Providers</h4>
      <p>
        We use other companies, agents, and/or contractors to perform services
        on our behalf or to assist us with providing the Service to you. For
        example, we may engage such service providers to provide marketing,
        communications, infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize
        our service, process credit card transactions, provide customer service,
        collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing
        such services to us, these other companies may have access to your
        information. We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your
        personal information, except in connection with providing the services
        we request from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        These vendors may anonymize and aggregate data collected from you and
        use that data for purposes of improving their product or providing
        services to us or other clients.
      </p>
      <h3>As Necessary In Certain Legal Circumstances</h3>
      <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to disclose your information, including your
        personally identifiable information, when we have a good faith belief
        that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is
        necessary to (a) comply with any law, regulation, legal process, or
        enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce our terms of use,
        including investigation of potential violations of our terms of use; (c)
        detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security or technical
        issues; or (d) protect against harm to our rights, property, or safety,

        permitted by law.

      <p>
        If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of
        some or all of our assets, including bankruptcy, our assets, including
        Member account information and personally identifiable information, may
        be transferred to a third party. At that time, your Member account
        information and personally identifiable information may become subject
        to that third-party&rsquo;s privacy policy.
