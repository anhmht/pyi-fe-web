      <h2><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINT POLICY</strong></h2>
      <p>
        PYIGroup provides users with a platform to sell their own merchandise.
        Users contractually agree to all terms prior to use of PYIGroup
        services. PYIGroup contractually prohibits users from using its services
        to sell merchandise that infringes upon third party intellectual
        property rights (such as copyright, trademark, trade dress, and right of
        publicity).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is PYIGroup&rsquo;s policy to block and remove any content that it
        believes in good faith to infringe the intellectual property rights of
        third parties following receipt of a compliant notice; and to terminate
        service for repeated infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been
        infringed upon by a PYIGroup user, please notify PYIGroup
        at&nbsp;legal@pyiexpress.net. You must include within your notification
        the following information:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
          behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that you allege is
          being infringed
        </li>
        <li>
          The URL to the PYIGroup campaign(s) used in connection with the sale
          of the allegedly infringing merchandise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the copyright, trademark, or other rights that
          allegedly have been infringed, including proof of ownership (such as
          copies of existing trademark or copyright registrations).
        </li>
        <li>
          Your full name, address, telephone number(s), and email address(es).
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material
          in the URL submitted is unauthorized by the rights owner, or its
          licensee, and such use amounts to infringement under federal or state
          law.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the
          notification is complete and accurate and that you are authorized to
          act on behalf of the owner of the intellectual property or other right
          that is allegedly infringed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>COUNTER-NOTICE POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe that a claim of intellectual property infringement was
        filed by mistake or misidentification you may file a counter-notice. If
        you materially misrepresent in your counter-notice that your design is
        not infringing upon the intellectual property, you may be liable for
        damages to the intellectual property owner (including costs and
        attorney&rsquo;s fees). Therefore, if you are unsure whether or not the
        material infringes on the intellectual property, please contact an
        attorney before filing the counter-notice. The counter-notice should be
        submitted to&nbsp;legal@pyiexpress.net&nbsp;and must include the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>
          Your full name, address, telephone number(s), and email address(es);
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material and its location before it was removed,
          either by URL to the PYIGroup campaign(s) used in connection with the
          sale of the allegedly infringing merchandise or PYIGroup campaign
          number;
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement under penalty of perjury that the claim of intellectual
          property infringement that led to the removal or blockage of access to
          material was filed by mistake or misidentification;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district
          where you live (if you are in the U.S.), or your consent to the
          jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where your service
          provider is located (if you are not in the U.S.);
        </li>
        <li>
          Your consent to accept service of process from the party who submitted
          the takedown notice or an agent of that party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you submit a counter-notice, a copy of the counter-notice may be sent
        to the complaining party informing the complaining party that PYIGroup
        may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business
        days. Unless the intellectual property owner files an action seeking a
        court order against you, the removed material may be replaced or access
        to it restored in 10 to 14 business days after receipt of the
        counter-notice.
      </p>
      <h2>REPEAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINT POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        If PYIGroup receives repeated notices that you have posted others&rsquo;
        intellectual property without permission, PYIGroup may terminate your
        account. PYIGroup has a system for keeping track of repeat violators of
        intellectual property rights of others, and determining when to suspend
        or terminate your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        PYIGroup reserves the right to terminate accounts that act against the
        spirit of the Terms of Service, regardless of how many strikes are
        involved.
